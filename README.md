# Detecting-Plant-Disease
Image classification project for detecting diseases in plants

**Overview**

This project analyses over 20,000 plant images of healthy and diseased crops. 
The crops include: 
Apples, Blueberries, Cherries, Corn, Grapes, Oranges, Peaches, Bell Peppers, Potatoes, Raspberries, Soybeans, Squash, Strawberries, and Tomatoes.  

In recent decades, farmers have experienced a devastating crop loss as a result of the changes in the environment; global warming, weather pattern changes, pest infestations, etc. This project aims to predict whether a crop is healthy or not! Early detection of disease is key for preventing the loss of a crop. It is especially import to salvage crops that are needed to feed families in their communities.

**Modeling**

Sequential Model

Initial Exploration: 



Baseline Model: 



Final Model: 



**Model Results**

Parameter Tuning: 

Made adjustments to prevent overfitting using Early Stopping and Dropout. Made sure all aspects of our model were set up to work in a binary classification model.
